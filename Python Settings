While using command line editor and to execute a python script, I follow the below steps

- create python file , name.py, when u do this way, python keywords and indendation are taken care by editor like vim.
- type the program
- chmod 777 <name>.py
- ./<name>.py

Why do we use #!/usr/bin/python
 - instruct interpret where the program to run this file can be present
 - alternatively, run instead of using "#!/usr/bin/python", execute program with python3 <name>.py
